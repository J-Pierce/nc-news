### Summary:

This project is a web application built to provide a frontend for a server and database previously created.

The articles can be sorted based on a number of queries to the API to search for specific information. This project was built using react as well as vanilla HTML and CSS.

The Server and Database are hosted online but may take some time to spin up after inactivity
